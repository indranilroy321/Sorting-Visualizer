# Sorting-Visualizer
Write 1 visualizer code for any Sorting Algorithm in Python

No more sorting specific visualizer code! How about we write one generic visualizer code in Python and push our driver code and functions to any sorting algo implementation in the internet and actually watch the sorting in progress. 

As a proof of versatility, several examples were taken from the internet. The credit for writing those sorting codes go to the rightful owners. This tutorial doesn't focus on sorting mechanism, we just want to have fun witnessing sorting in progress. 


This piece of code is tested with 20 different sorting algo implementations available in the internet and it is working with each and everyone of them. Below is the list:

Bitonic Sort

Brick Sort

Bubble Sort

Cocktail Sort

Comb Sort

Counting Sort

Cycle Sort

Gnome Sort

Heap Sort

Insertion Sort

Intro Sort

Merge Sort

Pancake Sort

Pigeon hole sort

Quick Sort

Radix Sort

Selection Sort

Shell Sort

Tim Sort
